# Homework 1 

## Summary
This repo contains all information needed to demonstrate that I've completed Homework 1. It exhibits the LaTex and Overleaf setup, the Git learning, and creation of a GitHub issue.

## Set up Overleaf and LaTex
- A Homework Manual was created in LaTex.
- Inside the manual, a chapter named "Team" was created, and this contains a paragraph about myself.
- Underneath the paragraph lies two `.EPS` figures.
- Another chapter named "Git Homework" was formed, and this contains a response to Part II.

- Solved all five levels in [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
- Proof of completion is in the Homework Manual under the Git Homework Chapter. 

## Create a GitHub issue
- A GitHub Issue was created with markdown.
- It displays a to-do-list that represents whether or not the tasks have been completed.
